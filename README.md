# Downloads

If you don't want to deal with compiling or managing the Go source, **you can download a binary built for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/j6k4m8/chorduroy/releases).**

# Example

```shell
chorduroy -f X554X5 -o Am6.png
```

<img src="docs/demo.png" width=150 />


## Usage

```
  -f string
    	Fingering (from highest) (default "X554X5")
  -o string
    	Path at which to save diagram (default "diagram.png")
  -s float
    	Number of frets to include (default 6)
```


`chorduroy` guesses the number of strings on your instrument based upon the fingering you provide. For example, if there are four characters in your fingering, the output will have four strings:

```shell
chorduroy -f 232X -o ukeG.png
```

`chorduroy` will also intelligently guess when a diagram can be "offset" to show chord patterns higher on the fretboard:

```
chorduroy -f 787X -o fretOffset.png
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Modifiable image size with commandline flags
- [ ] Custom colors and toggleable alpha/transparency
- [ ] SVG / PDF export
- [ ] ASCII output
- [ ] Web service to use online

### Probably not planning on:
- [ ] Barre notation. This is intended to indicate position, not tell you how to play.
- [ ] Fingering suggestions. See above.
- [ ] Instrument-specific notation
